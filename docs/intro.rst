Introduction
============

Picrin is a lightweight scheme implementation intended to comply with full R7RS specification. Its code is written in pure C99 and does not requires any special external libraries installed on the platform.

- R7RS compatibility
- reentrant design (all VM states are stored in single global state object)
- bytecode interpreter (based on stack VM)
- direct threaded VM
- internal representation by nan-boxing
- conservative call/cc implementation (users can freely interleave native stack with VM stack)
- exact GC (simple mark and sweep, partially reference count is used as well)
- string representation by rope data structure
- support full set hygienic macro transformers, including implicit renaming macros
- extended library syntax
- advanced REPL support (multi-line input, etc)
- tiny & portable library (all functions will be in `libpicrin.so`)
